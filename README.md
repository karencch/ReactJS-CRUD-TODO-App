Description: This project was done following a tutorial by "https://github.com/jamezmca/reactjs-todolist"

Goal: Practice Basic React concepts and create a To-Do List application

What I learned/practiced:
(1) Basic React structure (i.e., App.jsx -> main.jsx as 'root'); 
(2) React creates prop object; 
(3) How to pass props from parent to children; 
(4) How to use custom fonts; 
(5) useState hook manages state of the component; 
(6) useEffect hook kind of makes side effects (listens for events and runs code when that event happens). In this app, useEffect persists the list even with page refresh.
